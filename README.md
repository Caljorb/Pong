# Pong
First attempt at a project in Python. Trying to make Pong that runs using Turtle.

I meant to do a virtual environment but I think I just downloaded it to my project or something, rip.

Run on your choice of IDE (ik VSCode works), or run with python3 main.py

Controls:

P1: 
    w = up
    s = down

P2:
    up arrow = up
    down arrow = down

Pretty scuffed, and not balanced (ball can sometimes not have any y velocity from spawn).
